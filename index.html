        <h1>Project on Console</h1>
        <p>Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.</p>
        <p>Web developers often log messages to the Console to make sure that their JavaScript is working as expected. To log a message, you insert an expression like console.log('Hello, Console!') into your JavaScript. When the browser executes your JavaScript and sees an expression like that, it knows that it's supposed to log the message to the Console.</p>
        <script>
            console.log("Hi I am console screen");
   
            var first_name= "Agnishwar";
            console.log(first_name);
   
            var last_name="Mouley";
            console.log(last_name);
   
            var full_name= first_name.concat(last_name);
            console.log(full_name);

            var a= 16;
            var b= 21;
            var add= a + b ;
            console.log(add);
